<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alfred Emad, and I'm a 21-year-old from Egypt. I'm currently studying engineering, which I find both challenging and interesting.
  When I'm not hitting the books, I enjoy relaxing with video games or movies. I also love to swim and spend time with my friends.</p>
<p>Beyond my hobbies, I have big ambitions. I'm driven to succeed and hope to build a fulfilling career.
  I'm excited about the future and all the opportunities it holds.</p>
